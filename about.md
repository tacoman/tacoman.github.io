# Duchy of Taco

Duchy of Taco is the personal blog project of [tacoman](https://twitter.com/tacoman_x86). Topics include InfoSec, especially
CTF writeups, retro gaming, software engineering, and Detroit City FC. I'm not trying to maintain a tight focus. If it's 
interesting to me, I'll write about it.

# Who I Am

I'm basically just a giant nerd who likes cracking jokes and making people feel good about themselves. I have a lot of
interests, like reading giant books, or gaming, or riding my bike around, or attending soccer matches. I have some creative
outlets, such as painting minis, writing here, or more recently [PixelHobby](https://app.pixelhobby.com/). But being around
people and knowing I'm making a difference for people is what 
keeps me moving at the end of the day.

To that end I try to keep in mind the humans using the software I build rather than chasing technology for the sake of technology.
I'm involved in several community groups with a focus on trying to make things better for people as individuals, as that is the
only way to build up a truly solid group. And those groups of people are in turn constantly holding me up and helping me
both grow and remain stable through life.
