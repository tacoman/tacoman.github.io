# Duchy of Taco

Duchy of Taco is here to document my journey into InfoSec as I settle in on a new focus in my career as a software developer.
I'm learning a lot and getting into the world of CTFs, and I need a place to document it all.

I'm really more of an eater of tacos than a master of making tacos. Computers and video games have been my lifelong fascination;
wondering what was going on under the hood lead to a world of learning. When I'm not gaming on my RetroPIE or stuck in a computer
book, I like to paint miniatures, play soccer with [@The_HarpersAFC](https://twitter.com/the_harpersafc), attend [Detroit City FC](https://detcityfc.com)
matches, or go biking.
