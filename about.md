# Duchy of Taco

Duchy of Taco is the personal blog project of [tacoman](https://twitter.com/tacoman_x86). Topics include InfoSec, especially
CTF writeups, retro gaming, software engineering, and Detroit City FC. I'm not trying to maintain a tight focus. If it's 
interesting to me, I'll write about it.

# Who I Am

I'm basically just a giant nerd who likes cracking jokes and making people feel good about themselves. I have a lot of
interests, like reading giant books, or gaming, or riding my bike around, or attending soccer matches. I have some creative
outlets, such as painting minis, writing here, or more recently [PixelHobby](https://app.pixelhobby.com/). But being around
people and knowing I'm making a difference for people is what 
keeps me moving at the end of the day.

To that end I try to keep in mind the humans using the software I build rather than chasing technology for the sake of technology.
I'm involved in several community groups with a focus on trying to make things better for people as individuals, as that is the
only way to build up a truly solid group. And those groups of people are in turn constantly holding me up and helping me
both grow and remain stable through life.

# Community Work

I'm the director of [MiSec](https://www.misec.us/)'s Southfield chapter, which meets in Zoom twice a month for the duration of the
COVID spread in the US. We are an InfoSec community that holds talks on the second Thursday of every month, and socials on the
last Thursday of every month. Come join us! Our Slack and our Zoom meetings are open to the public and we're always looking for
new speakers.

I also maintain the [Guardbook](https://noonelikes.us/guardbook/) app for the Northern Guard Supporters
of Detroit City FC, which was derived from the [Hooligan Hymnal](https://github.com/Chattahooligans/hooligan-hymnal-app)
open source project from the Chattahooligans. The app's biggest use is allowing us to push news to supporters without
being reliant on social media applications, and allowing for fan engagement with the players. I'm also a member of the
Grenadiers, the team that pulls smoke bombs inside the stadium to celebrate goals, kickoffs, and the closing minutes of a match.
You can often identify me on the march to the match by my Pac-Man helmet.

# Identity Stuff

In 2020 I came out as non-binary and listed my pronouns as he/him/they/them, which probably confused a bunch of people.
Non-binary does not mean androgyny, such as being in a state directly in the middle of male and female. It's anywhere within
the entire spectrum, and for me, it's about 80-90% on the male part of that spectrum on any given day. He/him is perfectly
fine, my handle can be interchangeably addressed as "taco" or "tacoman" without any concern, and "Duke of Taco" is
still fine.

For me, this was liberation from the constant nagging sense from my male role models that I didn't measure up on a few
dimensions such as being completely unhandy, or how I processed certain emotions, methods of interaction, or interests. 
It doesn't require you to address me or treat me any differently than you did when I just said "male"- just keep doing what
you do and accept me for who I am and I'm happy to have you around.

Obviously every human is different in general, but the above is very much _not_ the case for many or even most enbies in
my experience. Talk to your friends to find out how they feel and to respect them.
